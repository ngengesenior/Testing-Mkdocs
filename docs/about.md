# About Us

The search for taste has been here for so long so we decided to take it upon ourselves the challenge 
of bringing up the best Python programmers. Check my facebook page at [My Page](https://www.facebook.com/ngengeseniorpython). I will see you there.

## Plans

We plan on building a community of developers around Buea and we feel that it is time for us to unleash those
skills and take them to the next level.We believe that with the help of God and our fellow developers, we can 
move the Buea tech ecosystem to a new level.

## Major Technologies

For a long while now it has been noticed that around the Buea community, people are much interested in web
technologies and Java.But this time around , we are taking a different turn. We want to build on technologies that
involve Python, Kivy,Android,Ios,C sharp and other popular framworks known around the community like laravel.
One of our developers has been enthusiastic about Kotlin especially due to its type safety compared to Java. We hope 
on embracing it in the nearest future.
